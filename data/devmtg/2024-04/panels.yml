      This panel is an opportunity to ask the team working on Carbon about any
      and all of the tradeoffs and experiments that they're undertaking, how the
      project and experiment are progressing, and more. A group of active
      members of the Carbon project will share what we've learned so far,
      including both things we're excited about and would recommend LLVM and
      other projects to look at, as well as things that haven't gone so well.
      We'll also be able to talk about what we have left to do, how we plan to
      approach it, and places where we likely need help.
