      Where do you see the LLVM project 10 years from now? Intermediate representation (IR) plays a central role in this question. LLVM IR can be represented on top of MLIR's data structures, but in practice it uses its own data structures. That creates a barrier in compilation pipelines and has other downsides. Is there hope for unification on a single set of data structures? How can we move towards such a goal? Let me show you a framework for thinking about these questions and some concrete ideas for how we can move in the right direction.
  - title: Implementing Language Support for ABI-Stable Software Evolution in Swift and LLVM

      Unlike its peer languages, Swift has made the deliberate decision to embrace a stable Application Binary Interface (ABI) along with native code compilation, such that separately-compiled software modules can evolve independently without breaking binary compatibility. Come learn about the impact that a stable ABI has on the design of a programming language and its implementation in LLVM.
