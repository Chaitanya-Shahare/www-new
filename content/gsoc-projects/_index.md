## GSoC 2024 Projects

Welcome prospective Google Summer of Code 2024 Students! This document is your starting point to finding interesting and important projects for LLVM, Clang, and other related sub-projects. This list of projects is not only developed for Google Summer of Code, but open projects that really need developers to work on and are very beneficial for the LLVM community.

We encourage you to look through this list and see which projects excite you and match well with your skill set. We also invite proposals not on this list. More information and discussion about GSoC can be found in [discourse](https://discourse.llvm.org/c/community/gsoc). If you have questions about a particular project please find the relevant entry in discourse, check previous discussion and ask. If there is no such entry or you would like to propose an idea please create a new entry. Feedback from the community is a requirement for your proposal to be considered and hopefully accepted.

The LLVM project has participated in Google Summer of Code for several years and has had some very successful projects. We hope that this year is no different and look forward to hearing your proposals. For information on how to submit a proposal, please visit the Google Summer of Code main [website](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/).
