This page is an incomplete list of the projects built with LLVM, sorted in reverse chronological order. The idea of this list is to show some of the things that have been done with LLVM for various course projects or for other purposes, which can be used as a source of ideas for future projects. Another good place to look is the list of [published papers and theses that use LLVM](https://llvm.org/pubs/).

Note that this page is not intended to reflect that current state of LLVM or show endorsement of any particular project over another. This is just a showcase of the hard work various people have done. It also shows a bit about how the capabilities of LLVM have evolved over time.

We are always looking for new contributions to this page. If you work on a project that uses LLVM for a course or a publication, we would definitely like to hear about it, and would like to include your work here as well. Please just send email to [ the LLVM-dev mailing list ](mailto:llvm-dev@lists.llvm.org) with an entry like those below. We're not particularly looking for source code (though we welcome source-code contributions through the normal channels), but instead would like to put up the "polished results" of your work, including reports, papers, presentations, posters, or anything else you have.
